# AUTOMATIC-NUMBER-PLATE-RECOGINITION-SYSTEM
INTRODUCTION
<br>
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is an advanced technology that uses image processing techniques to automatically 
identify vehicle license plates. This technology has become 
increasingly important in modern traffic management, law 
enforcement, toll collection, and parking systems due to its ability 
to automate and streamline vehicle monitoring processes. The 
primary objective of this project is to develop a robust and user
friendly ANPR system that can efficiently capture vehicle images 
and accurately recognize license plates under a wide range of 
conditions. The proposed system utilizes powerful image 
processing algorithms and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) 
techniques to deliver high accuracy and speed. It is designed to 
handle different lighting and weather conditions, support multiple 
license plate formats, and integrate seamlessly with existing traffic 
and security infrastructures. Through this project, we aim to 
enhance operational efficiency, improve safety and security, and 
contribute to smarter transportation systems.

OVERVIEW
<br>
With the exponential growth in the number of vehicles on 
roads globally, managing traffic, ensuring road safety, and 
maintaining security have become significant challenges. 
Traditional methods of vehicle identification, such as manual 
checking and human supervision, are not only time
consuming but also prone to errors. ANPR systems provide a 
highly efficient and automated solution by leveraging 
advanced technologies such as image processing and Optical 
Character Recognition (OCR) to identify vehicles through 
their license plates. This project focuses on creating an ANPR 
system that offers real-time detection and recognition of 
vehicle license plates. The system is designed to work under 
diverse environmental conditions, including varying lighting 
and weather scenarios. By automating the process of vehicle 
identification, the system can be used in applications ranging 
from traffic monitoring to security surveillance and access 
control in gated areas.
